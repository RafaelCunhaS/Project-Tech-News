## Tech News

CS project made while studying at Trybe, a web development school.

The goal of this project was to get news about tech utilizing __web scraping__ on the Trybe blog (https://blog.betrybe.com) and retrieving the content from the _HTML_ of its pages. All the data retrived is stored in a __MongoDB__ database. Through the main function of the program it is also possible to search the news by title, date, tag or category and also list the top 5 news by number of comments or by number of categories.
